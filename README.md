### A plugin manager
The idea is to create plugins that will help reduce common and repetitive tasks that cause high cognitive resource drain. Small meanial tasks that interupt the flow of mindless grinding eventually add up. I imagine this application like a character attribute: you gain varying -% CRD (Cognitive Resource Drain) for each plugins effectiveness.

What this does not do:
- Automate gameplay
- Play for you
- Grind for you
- Farm for you
- Give you free stuff
- Magically increase paragon points
- Homework
- Workwork

What I imagine:
- Blacksmith taks: salvage white, blue, and yellow items, repair gear on hotkey
- Gear Swap: Particularly Nemisis Bracers for spawning champs
- Possibly gear set swaps
- Skill set swaps: Predefined slot/skill/rune sets to have changed for you (calling it now: future patch feature)

This is an architectural learning process for me. There will be much spaghetti; but hopefully the small abstractions will withstand some future changes.
